I have, alas, allowed myself to fall,
To show the weakness of a heart untried,
And in the childish squabbles, heedless call,
Of one who in his youth doth yet abide.
I gave in to the folly of my pride,
And like a child, with temper rash and wild,
I tangled in the petty, fleeting tide
Of strife that marks the journey of the mild.
Now wiser, I stand humbled, filled with rue,
And seek to mend the harm my folly knew.

hello there, I am Lars
Hello Lars

Bugfix

Oh, life! Thou fickle and tempestuous sprite,
What art thou but a breath upon the wind,
A fleeting echo lost in cavern’d night,
Where shadows dance and truth grows dim and thinn’d?
Thou art the dream of dreams, the sleepless gaze,
The hope that mocks the weary and the wise,
A glimm’ring spark midst endless, aimless haze,
A question cast to unresponsive skies.

Is’t but the dust that stirs beneath our tread,
The restless earth that bears our transient woe?
Or art thou spun from threads of gold and lead,
A weave where joy and sorrow twine and flow?
If joy be all, then hollow is the quest,
For pleasures fade like mist before the sun,
Yet if but sorrow fills the aching breast,
Then life’s a wound e’er bleeding, never done.

What force compels the soul to rise and strive,
To chase the spectres of ambition’s gleam?
Why dost the heart beat fierce to stay alive,
When all doth wither like a morning dream?
Is it the yearning for some deathless name,
The hope our deeds might conquer Time’s decay?
Or love’s embrace, a pure and tender flame,
To warm the soul when night hath chased the day?

Yet what is love but yearning wrapped in pain,
A fleeting bliss the cruel Fates allow,
A rose whose thorns pierce deeper than the gain,
A crown of thistle set upon the brow.
And what is glory but a silver chain,
That binds the will to praise’s fickle call?
What peace remains when all pursuits are vain,
And kingdoms crumble ‘neath the weight of all?

Oh, life! Thou art the jest of gods unseen,
A jest most bitter wrapped in sweetest guise.
We grasp for truth where little light hath been,
And curse the heavens when all hope belies.
Yet still we strive, as moths to flame are drawn,
To grasp some meaning ere the night grows cold,
To leave a trace upon the ancient dawn,
A mark that Time’s own hand cannot withhold.

And so I stand, a soul of doubt and fire,
A weary pilgrim on a restless shore,
Whose feet tread paths of hope and lost desire,
Whose voice cries out, and shall be heard no more.
