Oh, sweet serenity, thou gentle balm,
That soothes the weary soul and calms the mind,
Thy presence, like the soft and tender calm,
Doth hush the storm and leave all strife behind.
Thou art the stillness 'neath the starry sky,
The quiet hum of earth that speaks no sound,
Where all is peace and troubled hearts may lie
In rest, and know no care, no grief unbound.

In thee, the world doth find its truest grace,
No war, no cry, no clamor breaks thy reign.
Thy touch is like the morning's soft embrace,
A promise that the soul shall know no pain.

For peace, sweet peace, is heavenâ€™s gift to all,
A treasure rich, though quiet in its call.
